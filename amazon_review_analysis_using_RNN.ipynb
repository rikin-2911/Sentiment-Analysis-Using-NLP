It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^"

If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy).

The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE.

I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the \"New Young\" of Japan seem to be creating an \"international\" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!"

You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the \"power-up segments\" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun. Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it."

         "As a former Alaskan, I didn't want to have to do this. But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book. Check it out at your library if you must."

The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it."

It is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices. The placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use.

Also, the top zipper is too small--does not go to the very edges of the bag--making it hard to put items in and take them out. Also, it's too tall, therefore, taking out items from the bottom is much too difficult, and it doesn't have large enough pockets for organization of lotions, mom's wallet, etc.The other disappointment was that the company does not pay for return shipping, or include a return label if you are not satisfied, so not only did it cost $6.50 to receive it, it cost $6.50 to return."

This is not a book about religioun, mercifully, or a book with the ancillary purpose of converting readers. Once he begins honestly addressing his gayness, the narrator's search for the stern, narrow God in his mind becomes a discovery of something bigger and truer than he imagined. He might name what he finds \"a state of grace\"; other phrases that would apply would be \"self-actualization,\" \"Nirvana,\" or \"the meaning of life.\" I hope this review doesn't turn off anti-religion readers -- this book itself is rather anti-religion while focusing on universal truths."

I looked inside the calibration hole with an ophthalmoscope to see where the end of the Allen wrench connected and there is no socket visible. When I tilt the unit, I hear a loose screw rolling around. This unit is defective. I like the simplicity of the setup and the beam is very bright, but this one is worthless. I now have to go through the bother of paying to return it and waitng for it to be replaced or repaired. You do get what you pay for."

These things are good. The soundstage is just as wide, if not wider, than I got with my Bose speakers and not only did I spend half the money, I got ten times the sound quality! The bass is good (I'm assuming you have a subwoofer) and the mids and highs are crystal clear, allowing me to hear subtleties in my music that I'd never noticed with any of my previous speakers. The BIC DV62si sound as good or better than some of my friends' high-end speakers, and when they try to show off, I can laugh at them while pointing toward the laptop I bought with the money I saved!"

In any event, I cared little for this film because I cared little (or nothing at all) for anyone or anything in the film, except maybe the tree. As noted elsewhere, there were many starts that went nowhere as did the film itself. Perhaps this made it such a dysfunctional experience, portrayed at its best? It's a dysfunctional film about dysfunctional people living in dysfunctional situation in their own private dysfunctional world. I'm glad I rented it. I wouldn't buy it even though it's chock full of excellent actors. I also wonder how successful this film would have been with equally talented but unknowns filling the roles."

I saw these bags and all the positive reviews here and thought I'd give them a try. Suction seems the same as with the genuine bags and they fit in the vacuum exactly the same way. Time will tell if they fill up as much as genuine bags; I've purchased off-brand bags before that just didn't get as full and I'd end up changing them sooner. So far I can't tell any difference between these and the genuine bags, they even look the same besides the color. The price was hard to beat.

Martin is also a victim and perpetrator of child abuse and loves his lipstick.Add an elderly Indian shaman, three brilliantly scarlet rednecks, a lovely and gutsy doctor, and all kinds of mayhem and you get WOLF'S TRAP.Gagliani uses music from those ephemeral 70s and 80s as his backdrop, even Alan Parsons Project! Being a child of those days, this touch was so nice.A really good horror book; one of the best in recent years!"

As with my older model, the attachments sometimes do not stay attached. I wish Revlon would come up with a better design for the attachments. Besides that, the styler works well. I have shoulder length curly/wavy hair and sometimes I want it straighter with some body. The Revlon RV446 does the trick. I can achieve great result in less than 10 minutes. I keep it on low, as the sound is very loud when on high. I don't find that the barrel is too big (and I have small hands)."

I love the idea of what she was trying to do, but the dialogue was goofy, girls' success was very unrealistic, and their eventual conversion rang hollow... After all their anger at God which was so strongly built up after the dramatic situations with their parents, the conversion sequence was sadly lacking in details. (It seemed the author wanted to tell the backstory and was eager to get on to the \"Christian\" part, so after one minor issue and a chat with a nice person, miraculously Mac is suddenly involved in a Bible study?) Too much time spent on frivolous details such as lists of Christmas gifts, and the detailed descriptions about clothing only made it feel outdated."

My previous electric mower (Taskforce) would slowly wind-down when the handle was released. I have one significant con: this mower doesn't cut worth a damn. I have never removed the blade and I use my Dremel to keep the blade sharp. The height is set at the mid-poiint of the adjustment range. However, it leaves about half of the Kentucky Bluegrass uncut, i.e., bent over, during forward motion even at a slow pace. I have to pull the mower back over the same strip to cut the remaining grass. Actually, I think it cuts better in reverse motion. I cannot recommend this mower. I wish I got the same mover those folks who gave this a 5 star rating got."

The lengthy and repetitive moralizing about gay rights seemed out of place in this book, and the subplot about Dannyl discovering his true feelings for his handsome assistant took far too much time. But, sadly enough, when the plot switched back to Sonea, the novel did not improve. Her continued hiding from the rest of the students, led by the school bully, coupled with her fear to fight back and unwillingness to call the Administrator or other friendly adults for help during the many vicious attacks, made her character far less appealing than in book one.I picked up the first two books half price at a local bookstore that was closing. I doubt I'll buy the third, though I might borrow it from the library if possible just to see how the tale ends."

The setup and the background of this movie was so awfully forced and contrived and even the actors' (including Kidman) reactions were unconvincing. I felt like I was watching a cheesy horror flick (like Scream). The movie had a very bad turn when the husband arrived. His arrival was utterly pointless and went on for a boring 30 mins. Finally the movie got back on track. The ending was not a big enough payoff for the hour and half of creaking floors, slamming doors and horrified gasps. To place \"Sixth Sense\" in the same category as \"The Others\" is an insult to SS. For better thrillers check out the \"The Shining\" and \"Carrie\" in which horror and terror lies within everyday life."

         "Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it."

If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation.

After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that).

I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up."

I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the \"dark\" series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!"

         "I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive. I will NOT be buying any further books by this author. What a shame."

         "We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry, however the faux leather began peeling. At first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes. I would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that I had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes."

         "I was never really a big reader before and somebody put me on to Patricia Cornwell. Well, now I can't put her books down. Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It's nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them, get close to them, and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character.I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series."

         "This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always \"one against the world\", Marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack, Lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic. In this book Kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings. It appears that a recently executed murderer, who Kay herself has seen on her autopsy table, is still around committing crimes. A number of murders occur where the executed murderer's fingerprints are turning up. Kay, Marino and Benton try to track a killer, but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere. This is a taut and totally believable thriller. I can't wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment."
